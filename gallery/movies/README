Vehicles--now with guns!

In this world, GREEN vehicles are dumb and head straight for lamps.

RED Vehicles are predators. They ignore lamps and home in on the
movement of green and blue vehicles. They are armed with three
long-range lasers.

BLUE vehicles worship lamps, and they run away from predators. When a
blue vehicle thinks a predator might be nearby, it does two things: it
yells out an alarm, and it fires a rear-facing, short-range defensive
laser. When other blue vehicles hear an alarm cry, they fire their
lasers. The net effect is that all blue vehicles often fire their
lasers simultaneously.

When a vehicle is hit by a laser, random brain damage occurs. The
various short circuits, disintegrations and other damage to nodes in
the brain can cause many interesting and unpredictable changes in
behavior. Each time a vehicle is hit, its color darkens slightly so
you can get an idea of how much damage it has sustained.
