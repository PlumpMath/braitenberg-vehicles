Valentino Braitenberg is a cybernetician and neuroscientist.  While he
was director of the <a href="http://www.mpik-tueb.mpg.de/">Max Planck
Institute of Biological Cybernetics</a> in Germany he wrote a very fun
little book called <i>Vehicles: Experiments in Synthetic
Psychology</i>.  Its 14 chapters present a series of hypothetical
machines ("vehicles") that display increasingly sophisticated behavior
through the use of extremely simple and biologically plausible
circuits and mechanisms.  By the last chapter, he has described
machines that not only act alive, but also seem to exhibit concept
formation, foresight, personality and free will.  <P>

Some of you may not believe that a machine can think or feel.  To
others it may seem obvious that complex machines can become as
intelligent as humans.  Either way, you will be shocked (if not
offended) when I show you just how easy it is to create an artificial
organism that has free will by combining a few astoundingly simple
circuits in one cute little machine.
<P>

Some information on Braitenberg's vehicles is available on the web.
My pages at <a
href="http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~wiseman/vehicles/">&lt;http://www.cs.uchicago.edu/~wiseman/vehicles/&gt;</a>
have some information about a little vehicle simulator I've written,
and you can watch quicktime movies of a couple simple machines in
action.  There are also some good notes on the book at
<a href="http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Vehicles/home.html">&lt;http://web.psych.ualberta.ca/~mike/Pearl_Street/Vehicles/home.html&gt;</a>.
<P>

For dessert, I would like to demonstrate a natural language
understanding system, DPMA (Dynamic Predictive Memory Architecture),
that I helped develop for NASA.  It is connected to a simulation of a
flying space robot called "AERCam" that's intended to float around the
space shuttle using a video camera to inspect the exterior (A dumb
version of AERCam just successfully flew on the last shuttle mission).
DPMA accepts normal English commands and queries and can hold simple
conversations.

Looking forward to meeting all of you,
