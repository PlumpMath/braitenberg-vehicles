<p> The Quicktime versions of the animations are much better than the
MPEG versions.  Quicktime viewers are available for <a

I could not resist arming the little critters.<p>

<font color="#00AA00">Green</font> vehicles are dumb and head straight for lamps.<p>

<font color="#0000AA">Blue</font> vehicles like to worship lamps, and
they run away from predators.  When a blue vehicle thinks a predator
might be nearby, it does two things: it yells out an alarm, and it
fires a rear-facing, short-range defensive laser.  When other blue
vehicles hear an alarm cry, they fire their lasers.  The net effect is
that all blue vehicles often fire their lasers simultaneously.  <p>

<font color="#FF0000">Red</font> vehicles are predators.  They ignore
lamps and home in on green and blue.  They are armed with three
longer-range lasers.  <p>

When a vehicle is hit by a laser, random brain damage occurs.  The
various short circuits, disintegrations and other damage to nodes in
the brain can cause many interesting and unpredictable changes in
behavior. Each time a vehicle is hit, its color darkens slightly so
you can get an idea of how much damage it has sustained.  <p>

The <a href="combat-world-2.lisp">world definition</a> shows some of
the recent evolution of the syntax (it has become prototype based,
with a library of object prototypes).

This run has three vehicles, each of a different type, and two lamps.
Green is the obsessive one.  She singlemindedly and frenetically
searches for and attempts to ram the nearest and brightest light
source, and has no regard for anything else (behaving like
Braitenberg's Vehicle 2b).  Blue has more self-control and more
intelligence.  She likes to find a cozy spot near a lamp and settle
down, but she will flee if a predator comes too close.  Red is the
predator; Light doesn't interest her, only the movement of possible
prey. <p>

How dramatic. <p>

The two lamps are standard.  For more details, see the actual <a

This run has two of the simple light-seeking vehicles that made
their debut in the first simulation.  It also includes three lamps.
What makes things interesting here is that the lamps have some
awareness of their surroundings: when they detect nearby movement,
they dim themselves.  Lamps can have as much intelligence as vehicles,
as is suggested by the <a href="world-def-2.html">world definition</a>
(In fact, the only difference between lamps and vehicles is that
vehicles can have motors and lamps can't.) <p>

The third run is more of the same things that appeared in the first
two.  There are two of each of the three kinds of vehicles from the
previous simulations, and a mix of smart and dumb lamps. <p>

There is nothing new in the <a href="world-def-3.html">world
